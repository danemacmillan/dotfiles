# Dotfiles

Dotfiles that work seamlessly between OSX and NIX environments.

This is the first iteration. It is messy.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/danemacmillan/dotfiles.git .dotfiles && cd .dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh`

### Notes

The installation will unforgivingly replace all the files in your home directory that match the files in this repo. Back them up if you do not want to lose them.

## TODO

- Standardize file formatting.
- Include package management.
- Abstract package management between OSX and Nix.

## Nods
