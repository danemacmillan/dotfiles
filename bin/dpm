# - Move package install hash tracking from in-memory Bash variable, to

# `dpm.d` directory, and passes it into the current shell's memory. This speeds
# up the shell as it does not need to run through and verify each package
# individually. Nevertheless, if an error happened, the new hash will be
# generated as though it were installed. This clears all the hashes in memory,
# so the install functions can fail the hash check and instead manually check
# for the existence of each package individually, which is slower.

# Delegate the install command for each dpm_install_* function.
#
# This abstraction provides the ability to create an override for each package
# name listed in the standard one-item-per-line package files directly under
# the `packages.d` directory. If a matching script for the package manager
# package is discovered, that script will override the default install behaviour
# of the native package manager. For example, on CentOS, the `weechat` yum
# package exists, but it is very outdated. This function will search for the
# name of the package it is about to install with the `yum` command inside of an
# optional `yum.d` directory for a script called `weechat_install`, and if
# found, will run the script instead of simply passing the `weechat` string to
# `yum -y install`. This allows for very powerful customizations, while still
# maintaining the simplicity of a basic newline-separated text file listing
# of desired packages.
#
# Note that the package name itself does not even need to exist in the native
# package manager's DB/RPM, so if some random package name like `foobarbaz` is
# passed to the simple text file list, it will check to see if a
# `foobarbaz_install` script exists for the given package manager.
