# General ignore file respected by:

# - ripgrep (rg) https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

# They both came to a gentlemen's agreement in this thread, which is a marvel
# to read, just because of the sheer speed they agreed upon a standard:

#
# Note that ag is aliased to "ag --hidden" which will search for hidden files
# by default. That is not the same as ignoring these files, as ag by
# default does not search any hidden files.
