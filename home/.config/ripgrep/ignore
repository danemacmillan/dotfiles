# General ignore file respected by:

# They both came to a gentlemen's agreement in this thread, which is a marvel
# to read, just because of the sheer speed they agreed upon a standard:

# Note that ag is aliased to "ag --hidden" which will search for hidden files
# by default. That is not the same as ignoring these files, as ag by
# default does not search any hidden files.
