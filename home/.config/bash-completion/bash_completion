# bash_completion
#
# This includes third-party bash completion scripts that are eagerly loaded.
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not add new completions here!
#
# This file only exists for backwards-compatibility with bash_completion prior
# to version 2, which only supported eager loading of completions. For all new
# completions to take advantage of non-eager loading, add them to the following
# directory: ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/bash-completion/completions

# into the v1 path at /etc/bash_completion.d, or a ~/.bash_completion file
