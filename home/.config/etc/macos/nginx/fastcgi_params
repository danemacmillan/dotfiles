# Most image thumbnails are between 5kb and 15kb. Most documents (though
# handled by the fastcgi_* buffer parameters that mirror the proxy_* ones),
# are between 120kb and 260kb. Eensure it can all be buffered into memory
# instead of temporarily written to disk. The best way to determine memory
# allocation is to think of proxy_buffers as a property of a single request.
# If most respones can be anywhere between 5kb and 260kb, with many images
# on the low end, memory should be allocated as efficiently as possible. In
# other words, for each request we have up, for example, 32 buffers, each
# at 16k each, or 32*16k=512kb. If an image is 12kb, it will only allocate
# a single buffer of 16k to handle it. If the buffer size was 512kb with
# only 1 buffer defined (1 512k), that would mean nginx would allocated
# 512kb of memory for a measly little image. That's not very efficient. By
# breaking down the buffer size, it helps nginx optimize each response in
# memory. That means an image of 12kb will only take up 1 16k buffer, while
# a document that is 260kb will occupy 17 16k buffers. A very large image
# that is 400kb will occupy 25 16k buffers.
