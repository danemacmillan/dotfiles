# iCloud Disk
#
# This is a utility for generating an "iCloud Disk," which is a technique for
# leveraging iCloud Drive to store disks created on MacOS as sparse bundles,
# which are more efficient on cloud storage, as they are represented as many
# small files instead of one large one. For example, a disk that is 500GB and
# mounted to the filesystem, which then has some of its contained files modified
# would not result in a 500GB file transfer to iCloud Drive, but only the
# "bands" that represent the area of the sparse bundle that were edited.
#
# The size of a bundle can be customized. By default they are 8MB. The best
# size of a band depends on what kind of content will be stored on the disk. A
# disk that will contain many small files (tens or hundreds of thousands) will
# benefit from a larger band size, as there is a balance that needs to be found
# between having too many files in iCloud Drive, which will not handle hundreds
# of thousands of files very gracefully, especially not ones that are constantly
# changing, as in the use case of writing software, and the need to reduce the
# overall bandwidth requirements of transferring too much based on relatively
# small file edits.
#
# This utility also by default encrypts the sparse bundle.
#
# Valid values for SPARSEBUNDLE range from 2048 to 16777216 sectors (1 MB
# to 8 GB). These are the size of a sparse band (sparse-band-size), so:
#
#  - 1MB band = 2048
#  - 8MB band = 2048*8 = 16,384 (this is the 8MB default of Disk Utility)
#  - 200MB band = 2048*200 = 409,600
#  - 512MB band = 2048*512 = 1,048,576
#  - 1GB band = 2048*1000 = 2,048,000
#
# How many files at most would be uploaded to iCloud Drive in a scenario where
# the disk is 500GB and the bands are 100MB? 500,000MB/100MB = 5,000 files.
# Considering this 5000 files could realistically mean 1M+ files, that
# significantly reduces the overall strain on iCloud Drive, while still making
# it useful for development. An example from current usage: I currently
# have 1,966,783 files in an iCloud Disk that is only 464 files in iCloud Drive,
# with an disk configured as 300GB with 1GB bands; of course, bands are not the
# only files that make up a sparse bundle disk, but it is generally safe to
# say that the bands make up the majority of the file count. The main
# calculation, then, comes down to how large should the bands be and how much
# tolerance does the current Internet connection have for uploading a band for
# even the smallest change to a file; a 500Mbps connection woudl then mean that
# it can upload (500/8)=62.5MB per second. Of course, this is wildly
# inefficient, but when dealing with a highly dynamic base of files and you have
# both the iCloud storage and bandwidth available, in addition to a need to keep
# a live copy of all work in sync, this is actually a pretty decent solution.
#
# In order for this to work with iCloud Drive, the generated disk name cannot
# end with the usual ".sparsebundle" extension, as iCloud Drive will interpret
# this as a single file and thus ignore the whole benefit of having a sparse
# bundle. By simply renaming it to have another file extension, this lets iCloud
# Drive see this sparse bundle as just a bunch of gibberish files that need to
# be individually transferred. Disk Utility does not care if the disk name has
# a random other name, as it can detect what type of disk it is when attempting
# to mount it.
#
# TODO:
#  - add validation
#  - create within the ~/iCloud/Disks/ path ($ICLOUD_DIRECTORY_LONG)
#  - tie into mounting
