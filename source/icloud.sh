# Figure out what is constantly syncing in iCloud Drive.
#
# For a while I noticed that iCloud Drive in Finder was always syncing. After
# watching the filesystem it was noted that it was my `dotfiles` repo whenever
# it was opened in a PhpStorm project. The IDE had a copilot plugin that was
# constantly syncing.
